# CHANGELOG.md

All notable changes to this project are recorded here, in chronological
order. Entries under **[Unreleased — working tree]** describe changes made
locally that have **not yet been committed** (see `git status`) — logged
honestly as such, not backdated to look committed. Entries under
**[Unreleased — committed]** are real commits, referenced by hash, that
haven't been part of a tagged release yet. This file is never backfilled
with invented history of either kind.

## [Unreleased — working tree]

### 2026-09-11 — Second-pass documentation audit and corrections

- Audited the full documentation set for internal consistency (see
  `HANDOFF.md` for the finding list: 0 CRITICAL / 2 HIGH / 5 MEDIUM / 4 LOW
  / 3 SUGGESTION) and applied corrections:
  - Added [ADR 0003](docs/DECISIONS/0003-authentication-session-architecture.md)
    (authentication/session architecture), resolving the bearer-token vs.
    session-revocation contradiction and promoting `sessions` to a core
    entity in `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`. Updated `docs/API_CONTRACT.md` and
    `docs/SECURITY.md` to match.
  - Documented the rate-limiting approach (in-process/PostgreSQL-backed,
    no Redis) in `docs/SECURITY.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
  - Added `RERANKER_API_KEY` to `.env.example`.
  - Added a target audit-logs API namespace to `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`.
  - Documented chunking-strategy comparison in `docs/EVALUATION.md`.
  - Added `.gitattributes` to the target tree in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
  - Reworded `README.md`'s opening to avoid any production-readiness
    misread.
  - Documented the Git-workflow bootstrap exception in `AGENTS.md`.
  - Made `docs/DECISIONS/` and `.agents/skills/` explicitly discoverable
    in `START_HERE.md`/`README.md`.
  - Clarified that baseline issue numbers in `PROJECT_STATE.md`/
    `AGENTS.md` are planning references, not existing GitHub issues.
- No application code, dependencies, schemas, Docker services, API
  endpoints, or GitHub issues were created — documentation only.

### 2026-09-11 — Documentation architecture established

- Populated the full documentation/project-memory system: `README.md`,
  `START_HERE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`,
  `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `SOLVING.md` (this changelog's sibling
  files were all previously empty placeholders).
- Populated `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`,
  `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/RAG_DESIGN.md`, `docs/EVALUATION.md`,
  `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Added `docs/DECISIONS/` with an ADR process, a template, and two initial
  architecture decision records: modular monolith over microservices, and
  PostgreSQL + pgvector as the initial vector store.
- Added `.agents/skills/README.md` documenting the intended skills roster
  and the RULE/SKILL/MCP/MEMORY/ADR/HANDOFF/SOLVING distinction.
- No application code, dependencies, database schema, Docker services, or
  API endpoints were added — this was a documentation-only initialization
  task.

## [Unreleased — committed]

### 2026-09-11 — `chore: configure Git line endings` (a059965)

- Added `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`).

### 2026-09-11 — `chore: initialize project architecture and documentation` (a7d81cf)

- Initial repository scaffold: empty placeholder docs (`AGENTS.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `HANDOFF.md`,
  `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `SOLVING.md`, `START_HERE.md`, `docs/*.md`),
  `.env.example`, `.gitignore`.
